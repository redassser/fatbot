# Fat Bot
> A fun bot for me and my friends in our personal discord server.
If you're interested in my work and want your very own bot, contact me, and I might take you up on some offer
My discord: pie#5319

### Misc Features

Fun times are to be had with the basic poll, which lets you create a strawpoll for users to vote in. You can make the subject anything you want, and users have 1 minute to vote by reacting to the poll before time runs out.
>.poll \[Subject\]

What's a bot for, if you can't make it say things it couldn't otherwise?
>.say \[\#channel tag\] \[Whatever you want it to say!\]

Want to show off how long you've been wasting away on discord? Find out the age of your account, and of other peoples' with the age command.
>.age \{optional user ping\}

Everyone thinks their pfp looks the best, so show it off, or take a look at someone else's!
>.pfp \{optional user ping\}

See the commands without having to come back here.
>.help

### The Hotel
The Hotel is the real showcase. My finest, and most original work so far.

At it's essence it grants users the ability to create private channels that are only visible to the user who wanted the channel and whomever they might invite. 
> Due to the way discord works, the server owner will always be able to access every channel regardless of permissions.

The first command you want to use to utilize the hotel.
>.hotel setup

Afterwards, use hotel help and become aquainted with all of our services.
>.hotel help

#### r34
And by services, of course, I mean the in-chat rule34 browser. Using this command, you can browse rule34.xxx images \(with tags!\) by simply choosing one of the reactions under the image to bring up new images with the same tags, or stop the feed of images. 
I'm almost as proud of this command as I am of the hotel, but this one is not exactly safe for work. Speaking of, this command is integrated with the hotel, allowing you to set up a blacklist of tags that apply to every use of the .r34 command in that hotel room!
